This work presents the development of a responsive institutional website for a photographic portfolio, aiming to provide professional photographer Geovany with a lightweight, easy-to-maintain platform to showcase his work and attract clients. The research is set within the context of the Analysis and Systems Design course at Universidade Positivo and adopts a pragmatic approach based on agile methodologies (Scrum/Kanban) and UX/UI best practices, supported by tools such as Figma, Trello, and GitHub. Requirements-gathering workshops, interface prototyping, and front-end implementation in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript were conducted, employing performance optimization techniques (image compression and lazy loading). As a contribution, this project strengthens photographers’ online visibility and offers practical learning in project management and web development.
